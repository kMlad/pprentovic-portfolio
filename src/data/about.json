That part of my education is not really connected with design most of the time but the diversity Is the thing that gets me going. On the other side,  after completing an extensive graphic design program, found my new passion for UX/UI. What really fires me up is building great products and being engaged with people who want to unlock their potential.",

It showed me how to be a team player, always on time, how to be dedicated and believe that we grow through the hard times. Although my path went in another way I will always love the game and appreciate the lessons. I also love playing cards listening to music and going on adventures.",
